*Attention Is All You Need is a research paper published in 2017 by Vaswani et al.
*The paper introduces the Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks.
*It completely removes the use of RNNs and CNNs.
*The core idea is that attention alone is sufficient to model sequences.
*The model uses self-attention to understand relationships between all words in a sentence.
*Self-attention helps capture long-range dependencies effectively.
*The Transformer follows an encoder–decoder structure.
*The encoder processes the input sequence into contextual representations.
*The decoder generates the output sequence step by step.
*Multi-head attention allows the model to learn different patterns simultaneously.
*Scaled dot-product attention is used for efficient computation of attention scores.
*Positional encoding is added to maintain word order information.
*The architecture allows parallel processing, unlike RNNs.
*This results in faster training and better scalability.
*The Transformer is the foundation of modern models like BERT, GPT, and T5.
